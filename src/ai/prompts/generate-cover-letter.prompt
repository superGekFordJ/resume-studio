## Instructions:

Write a complete professional cover letter that follows this structure:

**Date:**
- Include the current date at the top: {{formatCurrentDate}}

**Salutation:**
- Use "Dear Hiring Manager," if no specific contact name is provided
- If company name is available, you may use "Dear [Company Name] Hiring Team,"

**Opening Paragraph:**
- Express genuine interest in the specific position and company
- Briefly mention how you learned about the opportunity
- Include a compelling hook that highlights your most relevant qualification

**Body Paragraphs (2-3 paragraphs):**
- Highlight 2-3 key achievements from the resume that directly relate to the job requirements
- Use specific examples with quantifiable results when possible
- Demonstrate knowledge of the company's mission, values, or recent developments
- Show how your skills and experience solve the company's needs
- Avoid simply restating the resume - instead, tell a story that connects your background to their requirements

**Closing Paragraph:**
- Reiterate your enthusiasm for the role
- Mention your attached resume
- Include a professional call to action (e.g., "I look forward to discussing how my experience can contribute to [Company/Team]")

**Professional Closing:**
- Use "Sincerely," or "Best regards," followed by the candidate's name

## Writing Guidelines:

1. **Tone**: Professional yet personable, confident but not arrogant
2. **Length**: 3-4 paragraphs, approximately 250-400 words
3. **Format**: Use markdown formatting for structure
4. **Personalization**: Reference specific job requirements and company details when available
5. **Value Proposition**: Focus on what you can offer the company, not what you want from them
6. **Keywords**: Naturally incorporate relevant keywords from the job description
7. **Authenticity**: Ensure the letter feels genuine and matches the user's professional level

## Formatting Requirements:

- Include the complete cover letter with date, salutation, body, and closing
- Use paragraph breaks for readability
- Bold key achievements or company names for emphasis
- Ensure the content flows naturally and tells a cohesive story
- Format as a complete, professional document ready for submission
