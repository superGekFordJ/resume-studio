### 🏗️ Schema-Driven Architecture

Built on a **single source of truth** schema system that enables:

- Dynamic section creation and management
- Consistent AI context building
- Extensible data structures
- Type-safe development

### 🛡️ Privacy & Data Control

- **Local Storage**: All your data stays on your device
- **No Data Collection**: We don't collect or store your personal information
- **Open Source**: Full transparency with auditable code
- **Self-Hosted Option**: Deploy your own instance for maximum control

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+
- pnpm
- Google AI Studio API key (Gemini)

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/superGekFordJ/resume-studio.git
   cd resume-studio
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**

   ```bash
   # We recommend using pnpm as our package manager
   pnpm install
   ```

3. **Configure environment variables**

   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env.local
   ```

   Edit `.env.local` and add your Google AI Studio API key:

   ```env
   GEMINI_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
   ```

   Get your API key from [Google AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com/)

   > [!IMPORTANT]
   > **⚠️ Important Configuration Notes**:
   >
   > - API keys **must** be configured through environment files (`.env.local` or `.env.production`)
   > - UI-based API key configuration is temporarily disabled due to Genkit lifecycle constraints
   > - Currently uses **pre-configured Gemini models only** - no model selection available
   > - Multi-provider support and flexible model selection coming after AI system refactor(You could try it by cloning feature/ai-provider-backup branch )

4. **Start the development server**

   ```bash
   pnpm dev
   ```

5. **Open your browser**
   Navigate to `http://localhost:9332` to start building your resume!

### 🎯 Optimizing AI Performance

For the best AI assistance experience, we **strongly recommend** configuring these settings first:

1. **Target Job Info**: Go to Settings → Upload a job description image or paste the job details. Our AI will parse the requirements to provide highly targeted suggestions.

2. **Professional Bio**: Add your professional background in Settings. The system will help you format it while protecting sensitive credential information for privacy.

> [!NOTE]
> **Why this matters**: All AI features (auto-completion, improvements, reviews, generation) receive these contexts to provide personalized, relevant suggestions tailored to your career goals.

### 🔒 Privacy Recommendations

To ensure maximum data privacy when using AI features:

1. **Enable Google AI Studio Billing**: For enhanced data privacy rights with Google's AI services, enable billing in your [Google AI Studio account](https://aistudio.google.com/). This ensures your data is handled according to Google's enhanced privacy policies for paying customers.

2. **Review Data Policies**: Understand how your data is processed by reading Google AI's privacy policies before using AI features.

3. **Self-Host Option**: For organizations requiring maximum data control, consider self-hosting this application on your own infrastructure.

## 🔧 Extending Resume Studio

### Adding New Resume Sections

Resume Studio's schema-driven architecture makes it incredibly easy to add new sections:

1. **Define your schema** in `src/lib/schemas/defaultSchemas.ts`
2. **Add the section** following the existing schema format
3. **Register context builders** for AI functionality
4. **That's it!** Your new section will automatically support all AI features

The system will automatically handle:

- ✅ Form field generation
- ✅ AI context building
- ✅ Auto-completion
- ✅ Content improvement
- ✅ Data validation

### Creating New Templates

Want to add a custom resume template? It's easier than you think:

1. **Use our template guide**: Share `docs/ui/how-to-replicate-a-new-template.md` with any LLM assistant
2. **Follow the examples**: Check existing templates in `src/components/resume/templates/`
3. **Submit a PR**: We welcome high-quality template contributions!

Our hybrid rendering model ensures your templates can leverage existing atomic components while maintaining unique styling.

## ⚠️ Current Limitations

### AI Provider Support

Currently supports **Google Gemini only** through environment variable configuration:

- ✅ **Supported**: Gemini via `.env.local` or `.env.production` with pre-configured models
- 🚧 **Coming Soon**: Full multi-provider support (OpenAI, Anthropic, Ollama, etc.) after AI system refactor
- ❌ **Not Available**: UI-based API key configuration or model selection (temporarily disabled due to Genkit lifecycle constraints)
- ❌ **Not Available**: Custom model parameters or fine-tuning options

We're actively working on a comprehensive AI system refactor that will support multiple providers with flexible configuration options and model selection.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: Next.js 15, React 18, TypeScript
- **UI**: Tailwind CSS, Radix UI, shadcn/ui
- **AI**: Google Genkit, Gemini API
- **State**: Zustand with persistence
- **Styling**: CSS Variables, responsive design
